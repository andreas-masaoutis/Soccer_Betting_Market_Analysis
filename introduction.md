## The favourite-longshot bias in soccer betting

Why do we care you ask? Well, there is a lot of activity by professional/academic economists on that issue. The reason being, they are interested in markets and they see soccer betting as a market like any other. 

They usually concern themselves with this question:

> Do the prices in a market reflect the true probability of an event actually happening? 

If prices do reflect the true probabilities, then there isn't much one could do to consistently "beat the market" and make a profit, in the long run, by simply using the available information. So, if one buys many different stocks in the stock market at certain prices, one can expect to get the dividends and get a return on the investment. If that person then sells the stocks, he/she should expect to do as the rest of the market. If the prices have gone up by x%, one should expect to earn x%, and not more than that. 

Let us now turn to soccer. How do I know that the prices:

- 1.75 for Homewin
- 3.10 for Draw
- 4.80 for Awaywin

reflect the true probabilities for the match outcomes?

In order to get the probability of the event happening, implied by the price, we should divide the price by one. In that case, the above prices translate to these probabilities:

- 1/1.75 = 57% Homewin
- 1/3.10 = 32% Draw
- 1/4.80 = 21% Awaywin

And here is where the overound comes into the picture. The sum of the probabilities reported, is 110%. Why is that? Well, it is because the bookmaker gives lower prices than the true ones. If the prices quoted were exactly the true ones, then the bookmaker would not make a profit. Instead, the bookamker "discounts" the quoted prices by a factor.

And here is the catch. How do bookmakers adjust their prices in order to incorporate their profit margin? Different ways, can make a big difference. Let us see an example.

Suppose there is a soccer match which with the following characteristics:

- 52% Homewin, implies a true price of 1/0.52 = 1.92
- 29% Draw, implies a true price of 1/0.29 = 3.44
- 19% Awaywin, implies a true price of 1/0.19 = 5.26

Suppose we want to apply an overround of 10%. How should we do that? If we evenly split the overround then we get the prices we begun with:

- 1.92/1.1 = 1.75 for Homewin
- 3.44/1.1 = 3.10 for Draw
- 5.26/1.1 = 4.80 for Awaywin

Suppose that for some reason, we'd rather apply all the overround to the Homewin - unlikely but good for experimenting. In that case we'd get:

- 1.92/1.15 = 1.6 for Homewin
- 3.44/1 = 3.4 for Draw
- 5.26/1 = 5.26 for Awaywin

As it becomes obvious that the quoted prices can vary significantly, it is time for the favourite-longshot bias to come into the picture. Let us recall, that if the price for an event reflect its true probability, then in the long run, by choosing such events, one can expect to get the average return of the market. In the case of soccet betting, this is 1 minus the overround.

And that is where the problem is. There is evidence that by consistently betting on different prices, one gets different returns - something that shouldn't be. Specificaly, by betting on longshots, one has returns lower than the market average, while the reverse is true when by betting on favourites.

If this is indeed the case, could then the overround and the way it is being applied, be an explanation for what we observe? 

Let us see...
