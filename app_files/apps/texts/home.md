### The favourite - longshot bias and the bookmaker's overround

The site [Football-Data](https://www.football-data.co.uk/) has a large collection of data on football matches from more than 30 leagues, spanning more than 20 years, along with the corresponding quoted prices from bookmakers on bets for the HomeWin, Draw, and AwayWin. This collection of data is used extensively in academic research that aims at analysing market outcomes, including the validity of the efficient-market hypothesis; as of March 2022 a Google Scholar search with the Football-Data link returned more than 500 results.

The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) assumes that asset prices reflect all available information. If that were the case, then by using a piece of public information we should not be able to do any better than the market average. Yet, there is evidence that random betting on favoutites provides consistently higher returns than by betting on longshots; albeit with negative returns.

Our purpose is to:
 - graphically provide evidence for the favourite - longshot bias
 - and correlate the bias to the bookmaker's overround

There are four more pages where:
 - We introduce the main concepts necessary for understanding the rest
 - We present and describe the dataset we have at our disposal 
 - We provide different perspectives on the overround and how it varies across seasons and bookmakers, as well as across individual teams or whole championships.
 - Finally, we present graphical evidence for the favourite - longshot bias and correlate it to the bookmaker's overround.

Enjoy!
