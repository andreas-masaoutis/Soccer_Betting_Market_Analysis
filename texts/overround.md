### Analysing the overround

The following three graphs provide a series of perspectives on the overround:
 - how the market evolved along almost 20 years
 - how the overround varies for different teams
 - and finally, how the overround varies among the divisions

Some remarks:
 - The overround has seen a steadily decreasing tendency over the years, possibly due to the higher turnover and profitability of online betting, along with the resulting price competition.
 - Pinnacle Sports seems to have a rather distinct business model, with a significantly lower overround compared to the rest of the market.
 - Each bookmaker, for every season, has a specific policy for each division, with some variation for individual teams.
 - As a result, a bookmaker might on average offer better overall prices (less overround) compared to the competition, but not necessarily for each and every division or team.
