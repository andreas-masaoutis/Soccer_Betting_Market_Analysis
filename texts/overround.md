## Analysing the overround

There are three graphs that provide three snapshots of the overround.

First, we take a look at the evolution of the market over the years

Then we take a closer look at the level of team, and figure out that bookmakers have different pricing policies for different leagues, over the years

Finally, we focus on each individual bookmaker and see how they evolve their pricing over the years.
